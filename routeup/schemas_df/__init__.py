"""**Pandera DataFrame schemas**.

Contains the `Pandera <https://pandera.readthedocs.io/>`_
dataframe schemas used in the project.

We use dataframe schemas to perform data validation operations
throughout the project's code, specially in CRUD operations.

The files (modules) are organized by database tables, that is,
every database table has a module with the corresponding
schema definitions.
